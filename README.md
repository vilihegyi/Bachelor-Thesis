SecuRO is a E-Voting system using the Blockchain technology based on the Romanian CNP as a validator. It is a concept to provide a better and safer voting, , as the current method can be easily leading to corruption.

To play around, get into the back-end (securo) repository and follow README instructions to start the service up and then into the front-end (securo-webapp) to see the voting working.
